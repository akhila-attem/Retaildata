Identified key customer segments through RFM analysis and K-Means clustering.

Forecasted future sales using SARIMA and deep learning with LSTM models.

Built a hybrid recommendation system with LightFM to suggest the right products to the right customers.

Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, MLxtend, Statsmodels, Keras, LightFM, Matplotlib, Seaborn
